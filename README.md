### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ˜€ A motivated frontend developer with 2+ year of experience in creating and developing dynamic, responsive web user interfaces. I have strong passion in developing excellent and engaging user interfaces and as someone who enjoys solving problems, software development was an obvious path.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Church Management Software that helps churches to manage their processes and activities which include, but not limited to, automated first timers followup, offerings collection, service attendance, events, services or upcoming programs. While the church administration focuses on what makes the church grow. The application has over 2000 users and growing.


- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for work in a company that loves to build innovative solutions and invest in people to get work done, i dislike complacency and love excellence at work.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Nothing excite me more that solving a problem.
